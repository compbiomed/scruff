# scruff: Single Cell RNA-Seq UMI Filtering Facilitator

**scruff** (**S**ingle **C**ell **R**NA-Seq **U**MI **F**iltering **F**acilitator) is a package for processing single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) FASTQ reads generated by CEL-Seq and CEL-Seq2 protocols. It demultiplexes scRNA-seq FASTQ files, aligns reads to reference genome using Rsubread, and generates UMI filtered count matrix.

## Installation Instructions

To install `scruff` using `devtools`:
```
library(devtools)
install_github("compbiomed/scruff")
```

## Package User Guide

An introduction to `scruff` package is available within the package as a vignette which can be opened via running 
```
vignette("scruff")
```
## Example QC plots

The following figures are generated using data from [(Van den Brink et al. 2017)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4437) and **scruff** package.
